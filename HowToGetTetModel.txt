1.build a model in 3dsmax 
2.export as .STL file with ASCII
3.modify the extend .STL to .stl
4.in netgen.exe choose load Geometry (netgen need python3.5)
5.Generate Mesh and Export as Neutral Format (renamed .ttet file)
6.the exported file will contain point list,tet list and triangle list but not yet over now
7.put the .obj file and .ttet file together into ToolSet/NetGenAdapter the pre name must be same
8.build project NetGenAdapter modify the exe output directory in ToolSet/NetGenAdapter
9.run NetGenAdapter.exe that some .tmodel file will appear which is actually used by program
10.put the .tmodel file in resource directory then can be used in program
==================================
netgen:
Mesh Options:
	Mesh Size:
		STL mesh-size:
			STL - chart distance -> adjust complexity
